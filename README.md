# random_LOTR
Random LoTR character generator.

# Features
- Create Your own Lord of The Rings hero using my random character generator. Your hero will be of random race and gender. He/She will be assigned race and gender appropriate name, random weapon and one special ability.

- Create Your own Fellowship of The Ring! It's just like my character generator but now there is 9 of them!

- Create Your own Orc Army! Choose how big Your army should be and You will be given Orcs with their own names and weapon. (Just don't get too attached as they will probably die quickly.)

# How to use:
-  for single character add getHero() to the code and hit run. Your results will be shown in the console.
- if You want to create a Fellowship add fellowship() to the code and hit run. Your results will appear in the console.
- to get an Army of Orcs add createOrcArmy(armySize) to the code while armySize should be Your desired army size. Just make sure it is a number. You also want to have at least 2 Orcs in Your army. When ready run the code and check the console.
